title: Ant Design of Angular
---

Following the Ant Design specification, we developed a Angular UI library `ng-zorro-antd` that contains a set of high quality components and demos for building rich, interactive user interfaces.

<div class="pic-plus">
  <img width="150" src="https://gw.alipayobjects.com/zos/rmsportal/KDpgvguMpGfqaHPjicRK.svg">
  <span>+</span>
  <img width="180" src="https://angular.cn/assets/images/logos/angular/angular.svg">
</div>

<style>
.pic-plus > * {
  display: inline-block !important;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
.pic-plus span {
  font-size: 30px;
  color: #aaa;
  margin: 0 20px;
}
</style>
