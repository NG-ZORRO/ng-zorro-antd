## 1.0.0
`2018-06-11`

We released the first version of ng-zorro-antd 10 months ago. In those 10 months we received PRs from more than 35 contributors. Underwent about 386 commits and 35 [releases](https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro-antd/releases).

**Today, we are happy to announce that ng-zorro-antd 1.0 has finally been released. **

In this release we supported i18n in 35 languages, provided all components same as [react version](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce), refactored code for multiple underlying components, introduced new features of [schematics](https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2). We made this change to clarify cross compatibility.

All releases notes can be found [here](https://github.com/NG-ZORRO/ng-zorro-antd/releases)
