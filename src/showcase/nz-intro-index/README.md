> If you're new to learning front-end or Angular, it might not be a good idea to have the component as a first step, and it is recommended that you first learn about <a href="http://www.angular.cn" target="_blank"> Angular < a> and <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank"> TypeScript </a>.

## features
- Refines the interactive language and visual styles from the mid-level enterprise-class products and regularly keeps up to date with the Ant Design React release.
- High-quality Angular components out of the box.
- Built using TypeScript, providing a complete type definition file.

## version

- [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ng-zorro-antd.svg)](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ng-zorro-antd)

## support environment

* Modern browsers and IE9 above (requires [polyfills](https://angular.cn/guide/browser-support)).

## compatible version

* Angular `^5.0.0` version is currently supported (` `5.0.x` version is recommended below`ng-zorro-antd` below)


## installation

** We recommend using npm for development. ** Not only can you easily debug in your development environment, but you can safely pack it in a production environment and enjoy the benefits of the entire ecosystem and toolchain.

```bash
$ npm install ng-zorro-antd --save
```

If your network environment is poor, we recommend using [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

## standard development

In actual project development, you will need a series of engineering requirements for building, debugging, proxying, packaging and deployment of TypeScript code.
We recommend the official '@angular/cli` toolchain for development

If you want to learn more about the functions and commands of the CLI toolchain, we recommend that you visit [Angular CLI] (https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) to learn more
