When uploading state change, it returns:

```js
{
  file: { /* ... */ },
  fileList: [ /* ... */ ],
  event: { /* ... */ },
}
```

1. `file` File object for the current operation.

   ```js
   {
      uid: 'uid',      // unique identifier
      name: 'xx.png'   // file name
      status: 'done', // options：uploading, done, error, removed
      response: '{"status": "success"}' // response from server
   }
   ```

2. `fileList` current list of files
3. `event` response from server, including uploading progress, supported by advanced browsers.

## nzCustomRequest

Allows for advanced customization by overriding default behavior in `HttpClient`. Provide your own XMLHttpRequest calls to interface with custom backend processes or interact with AWS S3 service through the aws-sdk-js package.

`nzCustomRequest` callback is passed an object with:

- `onProgress: (event: { percent: number }): void`
- `onError: (event: Error): void`
- `onSuccess: (body: Object, xhr?: Object): void`
- `data: Object`
- `filename: String`
- `file: File`
- `withCredentials: Boolean`
- `action: String`
- `headers: Object`
