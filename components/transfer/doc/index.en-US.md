## When To Use

Transfer the elements between two columns in an intuitive and efficient way.

One or more elements can be selected from either column, one click on the proper 'direction' button, and the transfer is done. The left column is considered the 'source' and the right column is considered the 'target'. As you can see in the API description, these names are reflected in.

## Warning

According the [standard](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/lists-and-keys.html#keys) of React, the key should always be supplied directly to the elements in the array. In Transfer, the keys should be set on the elements included in `dataSource` array. By default, `key` property is used as an unique identifier.

If there's no `key` in your data, you should use `rowKey` to specify the key that will be used for uniquely identify each element.

```jsx
// eg. your primary key is `uid`
return <Transfer rowKey={record => record.uid} />;
```
