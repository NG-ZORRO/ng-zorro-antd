Wrapper for `Display: flex`.

## When To Use

- Good for setting spacing between elements.
- Suitable for setting various horizontal and vertical alignments.

### Difference with Space component

- Space is used to set the spacing between inline elements. It will add a wrapper element for each child element for inline alignment. Suitable for equidistant arrangement of multiple child elements in rows and columns.
- Flex is used to set the layout of block-level elements. It does not add a wrapper element. Suitable for layout of child elements in vertical or horizontal direction, and provides more flexibility and control.
