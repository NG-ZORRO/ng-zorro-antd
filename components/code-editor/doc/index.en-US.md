## When To Use

When you want to use monaco editor in Angular.

### Import Module

```ts
import { NzCodeEditorModule } from 'ng-zorro-antd/code-editor';
```

### Import Style

```less
@import "node_modules/ng-zorro-antd/code-editor/style/entry.less"
```

## API

Install `monaco-editor` in your project first:

```sh
npm install monaco-editor
```

### Dynamic Loading

If you would like to load monaco dynamically (which means you load resources of monaco editor right before you would like to use it), you will need to register assets of monaco editor itself. You can do that by adding these lines in angular.json file:

```diff
"assets": [
+ {
+   "glob": "**/*",
+   "input": "./node_modules/monaco-editor/min/vs",
+   "output": "/assets/vs/"
+ }
],
```

If you deploy resources of monaco editor on CDN, you won't need to modify angular.json. Instead, you must configure the `assetsRoot` property via `NzConfigService`. For example, you put resources of monaco editor on https://mycdn.com/assets/vs, you should provide `{ assets: 'https://mycdn.com/assets/vs' }`.

> If you are going to use static loading (which we will explain in detail at the bottom of this page), you don't need to modify angular.json file.

### Static Loading

Sometimes you need to load AMD module dynamically. But since monaco editor's loader patches `window[require]`, you can not use AMD loader like requireJS. In this situation you need to enable static loading.

With help of [monaco-editor-webpack-plguin](https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor-webpack-plugin) by Microsoft, you can do that in a convenient way.

1. Provide the value of `NZ_CONFIG` in `app.module` and set `useStaticLoading` in the `codeEditor` property to `true`.
2. Create a webpack.partial.js file, and config monaco-editor-webpack-loader.
3. Use custom webpack loader like [ngx-build-plus](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/ngx-build-plus) to load this webpack config.

If you use static loading, you should not add assets of monaco editor to your project by modifying angular.json file.
