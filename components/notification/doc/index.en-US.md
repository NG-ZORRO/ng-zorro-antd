Display a notification message globally.

## When To Use

To display a notification message at any of the four corners of the viewport. Typically it can be
used in the following cases:

- A notification with complex content.
- A notification providing a feedback based on the user interaction. Or it may show some details
  about upcoming steps the user may have to follow.
- A notification that is pushed by the application.

## How To Use

Similar to `NzMessage`, if you want to modify the global default configuration, you can modify the value of provider `NZ_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG`.
(Example: Add `{ provide: NZ_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG, useValue: { nzDuration: 3000 }}` to `providers` of your module, `NZ_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG` can be imported from `ng-zorro-antd`)

The default global configuration is:
```js
{
  nzTop         : '24px',
  nzBottom      : '24px',
  nzPlacement   : 'topRight',
  nzDuration    : 4500,
  nzMaxStack    : 7,
  nzPauseOnHover: true,
  nzAnimate     : true
 }
```

## API

The component provides a number of service methods using the following methods and parameters:

- `NzNotificationService.blank(title, content, [options])` // Notification without icon
- `NzNotificationService.success(title, content, [options])`
- `NzNotificationService.error(title, content, [options])`
- `NzNotificationService.info(title, content, [options])`
- `NzNotificationService.warning(title, content, [options])`
- `NzNotificationService.loading(title, content, [options])`
